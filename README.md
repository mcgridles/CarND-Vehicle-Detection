# Vehicle Detection

In this project, your goal is to write a software pipeline to detect vehicles in a video (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4), but the main output or product we want you to create is a detailed writeup of the project.  Check out the [writeup template](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Vehicle-Detection/blob/master/writeup_template.md) for this project and use it as a starting point for creating your own writeup.  

### Data

[GTI/KITTI vehicle dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/Vehicle_Tracking/vehicles.zip)

[GTI/KITTY non-vehicle dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/Vehicle_Tracking/non-vehicles.zip)

[Udacity labeled dataset](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car/tree/master/annotations)

I also performed [hard negative mining](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/2ggc5l/what_is_hard_negative_mining_and_how_is_it/) on the [project video](project_video.mp4) to help eliminate false positives.
